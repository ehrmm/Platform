To do
- Make general structure, intro, levels, pause, game over pass correctly
  - shape and rect need to update in __main__ sprites # group.update(sprite.shape, sprite.rect) works but not suitable for different enemies in the same group, may need to create more groups but this seems messy
  - work out how to render levels while maintaining game status when paused
